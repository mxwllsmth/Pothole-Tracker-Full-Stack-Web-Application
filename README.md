Pothole Tracker Web Application

This is a full stack web app created with the following technologies :

PostgreSQL  |  Java  |  Vue.js  |  JavaScript  |  HTML  |  CSS  |   IntelliJ  |  VS Code  |  MapBox - third party API  |  Postman  |  pgAdmin 4

This project was completed in a team of five using a mini Agile approach over ten days.

The goal of this project was to create a utility application for the city of Philadelphia to manage their potholes. Any person can create an account and report a 
pothole, any person with or without an account can view reported potholes and track their repair status, and an employee/ Admin user can update potholes to input 
severity and date inspected and/or repaired, and delete potholes when neccesary.

My teams code for this project includes a RESTful API server, a front end client in Vue.js, a normalized database, and a third-party API from MapBox.

If pulling and running this application :
Create an account and log in for user functionality, or log in with username: admin and password: password to use employee functionality.
If for any reason create an account does not work, there is a built in user account with username: user and password: password.
